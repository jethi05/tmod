# Tmod
Tmod ist a combination of things: vim, chmod and touch. Its for Developer on the Command-Line. Since I have to make a lot of different python scripts, so I wannted to make the Procces of making these Files and changig the mod faster!
## Why?
I made it, because if make a lot of nwe files (and they should be executable) I have to make up to three commands, just for one file, so I made this :)
## Get Started!
 - clone the Github Repo```clone git@github.com:jethi05/tmod.git```
 - go into the Folder, now you have two options:
 - 1 the dirty, fast way
    - go into the Folder type in ```bash setup_tmod.sh```
 - 2 the gentleman way
    - change the modification  ```chmod 700 setup_tmod.sh```
    - execute it```./setup_tmod.sh``` and have fun programming!
